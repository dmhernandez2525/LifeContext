# F12.2 Proactive Insights - SDD

## Overview
Added proactive AI-generated insights analyzing mood trends, journaling streaks, health patterns, and generating actionable suggestions.

## Files Created

### `apps/web/src/lib/proactiveInsights.ts`
- 5 insight types: mood-trend, health-goal, journaling-streak, activity-pattern, suggestion
- 3 priority levels: high, medium, low (sorted by priority)
- `analyzeMoodTrends()` - Detects positive or negative mood patterns from recent entries
- `analyzeJournalingStreak()` - Tracks streaks and inactivity periods
- `analyzeHealth()` - Evaluates step counts and sleep averages against thresholds
- `generateSuggestions()` - Creates onboarding suggestions for empty data states
- `generateInsights()` - Combines all analyzers, sorted by priority

### `apps/web/src/components/ai/InsightCard.tsx`
- Type-specific icon and left border color
- Title, description, and optional action link
- Dismiss button to hide individual insights
- Navigation to action route on click

### `apps/web/src/components/ai/InsightsFeed.tsx`
- Renders prioritized list of active insights
- Dismiss tracking via local state
- Empty state when all insights dismissed
- Integrates health store for data access

## Files Modified

### `apps/web/src/components/ai/index.ts`
- Added InsightCard and InsightsFeed exports

## Architecture Notes
- Insights are generated on-demand (not stored), so they always reflect current data
- Dismiss state is session-scoped (resets on page reload) to resurface important insights
- InsightsFeed accepts journal data as props for flexibility in different page contexts
- Action routes link directly to relevant app pages for immediate follow-through
