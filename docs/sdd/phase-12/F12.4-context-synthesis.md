# F12.4 Context Synthesis - SDD

## Overview
Added context synthesis engine generating periodic life reports with journal and health analysis across weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual timeframes.

## Files Created

### `apps/web/src/lib/contextSynthesis.ts`
- 4 report periods: week, month, quarter, year
- `getDateRange(period)` - Calculates start/end dates for a period
- `analyzeJournals()` - Counts entries, mood distribution, top tags, average length
- `analyzeHealth()` - Averages for steps, sleep, heart rate, exercise days
- `buildJournalSection()` - Narrative summary with highlights from journal stats
- `buildHealthSection()` - Narrative summary with highlights from health stats
- `generateLifeSummary()` - Combines all sections into a LifeSummary

### `apps/web/src/components/ai/SynthesisReport.tsx`
- Period label and date range header
- Collapsible section cards with icon, title, narrative content, and bullet highlights
- Generated timestamp footer

### `apps/web/src/pages/SynthesisPage.tsx`
- Period selector tabs (Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Annual)
- Auto-generates report when data or period changes
- Regenerate button for manual refresh
- Loads journal data from IndexedDB on mount
- Empty state when no data available

## Files Modified

### `apps/web/src/components/ai/index.ts`
- Added SynthesisReport export

### `apps/web/src/App.tsx`
- Added SynthesisPage import and `/app/synthesis` route

## Architecture Notes
- Reports are generated client-side from IndexedDB and Zustand store data
- Journal content is accessed as plain text (encryption handled at storage layer)
- Import tags (import:*, source:*) are filtered out from top tags analysis
- Report sections are extensible (location, photos can be added later)
