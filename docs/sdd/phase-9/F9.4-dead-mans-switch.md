# F9.4 Dead Man's Switch - SDD

## Overview
Added a configurable dead man's switch that monitors user activity and triggers automated actions (wipe, notify, or export) after prolonged inactivity.

## Files Created

### `apps/web/src/lib/deadManSwitch.ts`
- `getSwitchStatus()` - Calculates days inactive, days until trigger, urgency level (safe/warning/critical)
- `shouldTrigger()` - Boolean check if inactivity threshold has been reached
- `getActionLabel()` / `getActionDescription()` - Display helpers for action types
- `THRESHOLD_OPTIONS` - Configurable intervals: 30d, 60d, 90d, 6mo, 1yr
- `SwitchAction` type: 'wipe' | 'notify' | 'export'
- `SwitchStatus` interface with urgency classification

### `apps/web/src/components/security/DeadManSwitch.tsx`
- Enable/disable toggle in header
- Status card with urgency-based color coding (green/yellow/red)
- "I'm still here" button to manually reset activity timer
- Inactivity threshold selector
- Action picker with descriptions (wipe, notify, export)
- Emergency contact management (add/remove emails) for notify/export actions

## Architecture Decisions
- Activity tracking uses the existing `lastActivity` timestamp in security-store
- Urgency levels: safe (>14 days), warning (7-14 days), critical (<7 days)
- Emergency contacts stored as string array in security-store
- Contact management only shown for notify/export actions (not wipe)
- Manual "I'm still here" button provides explicit activity recording
- Actual trigger execution is deferred (infrastructure for future service worker or background check)
