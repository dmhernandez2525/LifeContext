# F7.4 Public Roadmap SDD

## Metadata
- Feature: F7.4 Public Roadmap
- Phase: 7
- Status: Complete
- Owner: Web App
- Updated: 2026-02-16

## Goals
- Refactor PublicRoadmapPage to use data hook with mock fallback.
- Add milestone view grouping features by milestone with progress bars.
- Add board/milestone view toggle.
- Add milestone badges on individual roadmap cards.
- Add dynamic stats from data instead of hardcoded values.

## Architecture

### useRoadmap Hook (`src/hooks/useRoadmap.ts`)
- `RoadmapItem` interface with milestone, progress, completedDate, linkedFeatureCount
- Returns grouped items (planned/in_progress/completed), milestones, and stats
- Milestones extracted from items with `milestone` field, deduped via Map
- Stats computed: planned, inProgress, completed, total, totalVotes

### MilestoneSection (`src/components/roadmap/MilestoneSection.tsx`)
- Grid of milestone cards with name, progress bar, and item list
- Each item shows status icon (color-coded), title, and vote count
- Progress calculated from completed items ratio within each milestone

### Refactored PublicRoadmapPage
- Board view (columns) and Milestone view toggle
- RoadmapCard component extracted with milestone badge display
- Dynamic stats from useRoadmap hook (no hardcoded values)
- Mobile column selector only visible in board view mode

## Testing Plan
- Unit: useRoadmap groups items by status correctly
- Unit: Milestones are extracted and deduplicated
- Unit: Stats reflect actual data counts
- Integration: View toggle switches between board and milestone layouts
- Integration: Milestone progress bars reflect completion ratio
- Integration: Mobile column selector filters visible columns
