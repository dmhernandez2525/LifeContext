# F8.2 GDPR Automation - SDD

## Overview
Enhanced GDPR request management with deadline tracking, compliance dashboard, expandable request tracker with status management, and per-platform deadline awareness.

## Components Created

### `apps/web/src/lib/gdprDeadlines.ts`
- Per-platform deadline lookup (30 or 45 days depending on platform)
- Deadline date calculation from sent date
- Days remaining computation with overdue detection
- Compliance status classification: on-track, due-soon (<=7 days), overdue, complete, failed
- Aggregate compliance stats: total, pending, overdue, received, parsed, failed, compliance rate, avg response days

### `apps/web/src/components/gdpr/RequestTracker.tsx`
- Expandable request list sorted by urgency (overdue first, then pending)
- Per-request deadline countdown with color-coded status badges
- Expanded view showing deadline date, status, received date
- Action buttons: Mark Received, Mark Failed, Mark Parsed (contextual per status)

### `apps/web/src/components/gdpr/ComplianceDashboard.tsx`
- Top metrics: compliance rate percentage and average response days
- Status breakdown grid: pending, overdue, received, failed counts
- Segmented progress bar showing distribution of request statuses

### `apps/web/src/components/gdpr/index.ts`
- Barrel export for RequestTracker and ComplianceDashboard

## Store Changes

### `apps/web/src/store/data-reclamation-store.ts`
- Added `markGDPRReceived` action that sets status to 'received' and records receivedDate

## Page Changes

### `apps/web/src/pages/GDPRRequestPage.tsx`
- Integrated ComplianceDashboard and RequestTracker in two-column layout
- Platform cards now show green check when request already sent
- Extracted TemplateModal and CopyField as local components for clarity
- Added useCallback wrappers for copy and mark-as-sent handlers

## Architecture Decisions
- Deadline calculations are pure functions for testability
- Platform deadlines are configurable via lookup table with 30-day default
- Request list sorts by urgency to surface overdue items first
- Status transitions are one-directional: pending -> received -> parsed (or pending -> failed)
